        <h1>Support GMLsnip</h1>
        <p>GMLsnip is a hobby project being developed passively. If you want to support the project and keep it alive, then there's a few ways you can show support.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to donate to the lead developer, you can make a <a href="https://paypal.me/zackbanack" target="_blank">donation on PayPal</a>. <i class="far fa-heart"></i> All monetary support for GMLsnip will go first, and foremost, into keeping the website up and running.</li>
            <li>Please consider disabling ad-blocking software. The small amount of revenue earned by showing non-instrusive banner ads helps pay for web hosting and serving the API.</li>
            <li>If you're a developer, you can directly contribute to the code as its all <a href="/github">open source</a>.</li>
            <li>Share this website with friends and those who may benefit from it! Make cool stuff using GMLsnip and tell me about it!</li>
