        <h1>Support GMLsnip</h1>
        <p>GMLsnip is a hobby project being developed passively. If you want to support the project and keep this website (and <a href="/gmlsnip/docs" title="API Documentation">API</a>) up and running, there's a few ways you can show support.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to donate to the lead developer, you can make a <a href="https://paypal.me/zackbanack" target="_blank">donation on PayPal</a>. All monetary support for GMLsnip will go first and foremost to website hosting. Donations are 100% optional and greatly appreciated.<ul><li>If PayPal isn't ideal, you can consider purchasing <a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/320/zack-banack" title="GameMaker assets" target="_blank">GameMaker assets</a> from the developer via the YoYo Games Marketplace.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Please consider disabling ad-blocking software while using this website. The small amount of revenue earned by showing non-instrusive banner ads helps pay for the hosting and serving the API.</li>
            <li>If you're a developer, you can directly contribute to the code as its all <a href="/gmlsnip/github">open source</a>.</li>
            <li>Share this website with friends and those who may benefit from it! Make cool stuff using GMLsnip and tell me about it!</li>
